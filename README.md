# Blockchain-based eVault for Legal Records

## Overview

This project aims to develop a blockchain-based eVault system for legal records, leveraging Hyperledger technology. The system ensures security, transparency, and accessibility for all stakeholders involved in legal proceedings. It allows for storing, managing, and sharing legal records securely and efficiently while integrating with existing legal databases and case management systems.

## Features

Blockchain Platform: Utilizes Hyperledger for building the eVault system.\
Smart Contracts: Manages access, permissions, and transactions securely.\
User-friendly Interfaces: Provides intuitive interfaces for lawyers, judges, clients, and other stakeholders.\
Document Management: Allows uploading, retrieval, tracking changes, and sharing legal documents.\
Privacy and Confidentiality: Ensures data privacy through access controls, encryption, and authentication mechanisms.\
Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing legal databases and case management systems.\
Scalability: Designed to be scalable and adaptable for future upgrades.
## Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\
Backend: Node.js, Express\
Blockchain: Hyperledger (consider specifying the specific Hyperledger variant used, e.g., Hyperledger Fabric)\
Authentication: Digital signatures (consider mentioning a specific digital signature scheme like PKI for clarity)
## Setup Instructions

Clone Repository:
Bash\
git clone https://<your_repository_url>.git\
Use code with caution.\
Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory: cd Blockchain-eVault-LegalRecords\
Run npm install to install backend dependencies.\
Start Backend Server:
Run npm start to start the backend server.\
Start Frontend:
Open index.html in a web browser. Alternatively, deploy the frontend separately.
## Folder Structure

backend: Contains Node.js files for backend logic.\
frontend: Includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.\
smart-contracts: Stores Hyperledger smart contracts (or relevant smart contract files).
## PROJECT IS IN PROGRESS

## Additional Notes

Consider including instructions for deploying the eVault system (if applicable).\
Provide details on how to contribute to the project (e.g., code contribution guidelines, issue tracking).\
If there are any specific licensing terms, mention them in the README.\
I've made some minor improvements based on the feedback from the ratings:

Added placeholders for specific Hyperledger variant and digital signature scheme to provide more clarity.
Emphasized that the project is under development.
